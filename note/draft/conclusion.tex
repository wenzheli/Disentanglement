In this paper, we present new probabilistic models for learning the disentangled representations. We first provide the methods for the problem with known block structure, and later we generalize it to the case of unknown block structure by putting variable clustering prior. For the future work, we plan to extend it to the nonparametric case when the number of blocks is also unknown. More empirical evaluation can be conducted on more complicated datasets.
