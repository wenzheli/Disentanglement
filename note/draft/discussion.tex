In this paper, we propose a generative model for learning disentangled latent representations. From the preliminary results, we could easily see that the learned representations have the effects of disentangling, although it's hard to get the complete disentangled representations from our methods. But this is reasonable since we haven't use any other information such as labels.

For the future work, we plan to extend our current model to nonparametric by using Dirichlet process, which should be straightforward.
