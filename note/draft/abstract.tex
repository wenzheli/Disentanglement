We present a probabilistic model to automatically discover the disentangle factors of variation in the data. Compared to the previous approaches which mainly focus on learning two factors of variation by leveraging the label information, our method, on the other hand, works completely in an unsupervised way, and is designed to discover arbitrarily number of factors from the data. The key idea is to make a constraint that the latent representations are drawn from a prior distribution whose covariance matrix is block diagonal. The first method we propose is based on the known block structure, then we generalize this method to unknown block structure. We evaluate our methods on three different image datasets, the results show that our methods can effectively discover underlying hidden factors of variation.
